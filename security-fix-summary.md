### âœ… Manual Package Replacements
1. **xlsx â†’ exceljs**: Replaced vulnerable xlsx package with secure alternative
   - Files processed: 3 core Excel export components
   - Migration automated with custom script
   - All Excel export functionality preserved

2. **react-to-pdf@2.0.1**: Updated to fix DOMPurify XSS vulnerability
   - Breaking change handled successfully
   - PDF generation functionality maintained

### ðŸŸ¡ Remaining Vulnerabilities (9 total)
All remaining vulnerabilities are in development dependencies and require `npm audit fix --force`:

1. **nth-check** (High) - Inefficient RegExp in SVG processing
2. **postcss** (Moderate) - Line return parsing error  
3. **webpack-dev-server** (Moderate) - Development-only security issue

**Note**: These are development-only vulnerabilities that don't affect production builds.
