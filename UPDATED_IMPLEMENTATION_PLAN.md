   - "Is it new item" changes YES→NO during edit
   - Date vanishes when edit used
   - Receiving date auto-fills incorrectly

2. AFC PM Logbook Monthly Gate (pm-logbook-monthly-gate-mainline):
   - Station name, date, month vanish after edit
   - Fields missing during PDF edit

3. Signalling Station Diary (station-diary-signalling):
   - Complete data disappears on edit
   - Station info missing in view

4. Telecom Officer Colony (officer-colony):
   - "Verified by" field disappears on edit

5. PM Point Machine TDP (pm-point-maintenance-record-tpd):
   - Date changes after edit
   - Date of replacement field disappears

6. Signalling Hardware Failure (hardware-failure):
   - Cannot edit station and system fields
