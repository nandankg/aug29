├── shared/              # Shared utilities
└── store/               # Redux store (420+ reducers)
```

### Architectural Strengths
1. **Functional Coverage**: Comprehensive form management capabilities
2. **Modern React**: Uses hooks, functional components, latest patterns
3. **Redux Toolkit**: Modern state management with proper patterns
4. **Component Modularity**: Well-separated form/edit/table components
5. **Feature Complete**: Extensive operational form coverage

### Critical Architectural Problems

#### 1. Developer-Centric Organization (Anti-Pattern)
**Problem**: Code organized by developer names instead of business features
```
❌ BAD: src/forms/akshra/TelecomForm.jsx
❌ BAD: src/forms/chanchal/TelecomMaintenance.jsx
✅ GOOD: src/features/telecom/forms/MaintenanceForm.jsx
✅ GOOD: src/features/telecom/forms/RegisterForm.jsx
```

**Impact**:
- Knowledge silos and team dependencies
- Difficult code reuse and standardization
- Merge conflicts in shared components
- Onboarding complexity for new developers

#### 2. Monolithic App.js (3,480 lines)
**Problem**: Single file handling entire application routing
```javascript
// Current problematic structure
const Component1 = lazy(() => import("./forms/akshra/Component1"));
const Component2 = lazy(() => import("./forms/chanchal/Component2"));
// ... 300+ more imports creating massive bundle
```

**Impact**:
- Slow initial parse time (JavaScript parsing bottleneck)
- Ineffective code splitting despite lazy loading
- Poor maintainability and development experience
- Bundle optimization challenges

#### 3. Redux Store Complexity (420+ Reducers)
**Problem**: Massive state tree with duplicate and conflicting reducers
```javascript
// Store structure issues
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    incidentsignals: IncidentRegisterSignalsReducer,        // Line 230
    incidentsignals: IncidentRegisterSignalsReducer,        // Line 308 - DUPLICATE!
    incidentsignals: IncidentRegisterSignalsReducer,        // Line 326 - DUPLICATE!
    // ... 417+ more reducers
  }
});
```

**Impact**:
- State corruption from duplicate keys
- Memory overhead and performance degradation
- Complex debugging and testing scenarios
- Maintenance nightmare for state management

## Critical Issues Assessment

### Priority Matrix

| Issue | Severity | Business Impact | User Impact | Implementation Effort |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Memory Leak (1s polling) | Critical | High | High | Low (2 hours) |
| Bundle Size (App.js) | Critical | High | High | Medium (1 week) |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Critical | High | Medium | Low-Medium (2-3 days) |
| Redux Store Corruption | High | Medium | Medium | High (2-3 weeks) |
| Zero Accessibility | High | High | High | High (4-6 weeks) |
| Console Log Pollution | Medium | Low | Low | Low (1 day) |

### Issue #1: Memory Leak - CRITICAL
**Location**: `src/tables/store/NightAfcGateDrilList.jsx:40`
```javascript
// CRITICAL ISSUE - API call every second!
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    dispatch(fetchData({ formType: slug }));
  }, 1000); // 🚨 EVERY SECOND!
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [dispatch]); // Missing 'slug' dependency
```

**Impact Analysis**:
- **Battery Drain**: Continuous API calls on mobile devices
- **Server Load**: 3,600 API calls per hour per user
- **Network Overhead**: Unnecessary bandwidth consumption
- **Performance**: Client-side processing overhead

**Immediate Fix Required**:
```javascript
// FIXED VERSION
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    dispatch(fetchData({ formType: slug }));
  }, 30000); // Every 30 seconds instead of 1 second
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [dispatch, slug]); // Proper dependencies
```

### Issue #2: Bundle Size Crisis - CRITICAL
**Problem**: App.js contains 300+ lazy imports creating ineffective code splitting

**Analysis**:
```javascript
// Current bundle structure
Main Bundle: ~10MB (uncompressed)
├── App.js parsing: ~2-3 seconds
├── Route resolution: ~1-2 seconds  
├── Component loading: ~2-4 seconds
└── Total Initial Load: ~5-9 seconds
```

**Solution Architecture**:
```javascript
// Proposed route-based splitting
const AdminRoutes = lazy(() => import("./routes/AdminRoutes"));
const EmployeeRoutes = lazy(() => import("./routes/EmployeeRoutes"));
const MaintenanceRoutes = lazy(() => import("./routes/MaintenanceRoutes"));

// Expected improvement
Main Bundle: ~2MB (75% reduction)
Initial Load: ~1-2 seconds (80% improvement)
```

### Issue #3: Console Log Pollution - MEDIUM
**Problem**: 4,112 console statements across 930 files in production

**Impact**:
- Production performance overhead
- Potential memory leaks through object retention
- Development debugging noise
- Bundle size inflation

**Automated Solution**:
```bash
# Remove all console statements
find src/ -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" | xargs grep -l "console\." | \
xargs sed -i '/console\./d'

# Prevent future console statements
# ESLint rule: "no-console": "error"
```
